- code agnostism can be challenging to implement effectively in advance when leaving the interface implementation for other codes to future developers.
- Strategies to increase code sustainability in an open-source code with a small user base: improving documentation, variable names, and program flow. Using CI to automate testing. 

- Good approaches for bringing large features into previously existing projects: get in contact w/ existing devs or author. make discussions post in whatever forum the community uses (or if it doesn't exist, make it yourself!)
- Various snags I ran into related to dependencies and how I approached solving them: PyNE
- What could have made the process from going from a user to a developer more smooth? Maybe try to frame it this way
